								<h3> <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/en/">Pokemon Go</a></h3>
								<p>This app is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">augmented reality game</a>.</p> Although Big Picture is not a game, we will use a similar approach to how they show the pokemon in the real world, but instead of being a character the frame will be found by following the arrows on the screen.Like a Pokemon Go gym, the only way you can gain access to this feature is by being at a certain location..</p>

								<h3><a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a></h3>

								<p>This is a photosharing platform that allows users to share their photographs and create a profile. Each photo uploaded has the specs of the camera that took the photo below it. Big Picture would have similar timelines for users individual profiles but not only would it show the camera specs users can share the experiences on the day they went to the location, what the weather was like, if it was cloudy or clear etc... The feature that makes us different is the collaboration photos, where many peoples photos are collaged into 360 degrees interactive image, where users can drag on the photo to look around and click on apart of the photo and be sent to that section of the photo's creator. Connecting those who have a shared experience of visiting a location and connecting their paths that never had the chance to cross at the actual location. Like Flickr, an online photosharing website, but Big Picture is dedicated towards scenery and can only access certain groups by visting the location for that group and scanning the QR code</p>

								<h3> <a href="=https://juliannatakesphotos.wordpress.com/2015/03/06/klett-wolfe/">Collaged photos of the same location</a></h3>
								<p>Big Picture will have a collaged photo of each location created by allowing users to add their own photos to the 360 degree view. As demonstrated by this collage photo below by Klett and Wolfe. </p>
