								<h2>About Big Picture</h2>
								<p>Big picture is a project that aims to connect people who travel similar paths but don't physically cross paths so we create a network of users who share a common ground and allow them to cross internet paths and compare experiences. Each visitor to a location has the chance to be apart of this joint exploration of our lands, seas and views all from their phones, laptops and other wifi-camera devices.</p>

								<h2>How does it work?<br />
								</h2>
								<p>Go to one of the many places we include on the site/app. You will find a branded sticker on the floor. Stand on this spot. By your feet there is another sticker, this one has a QR code. Scan that on our app. The app takes you to the home page for the location you are at. At the top of this page is a button labelled "Add To Collaboration". Click this. This takes you to our in-app camera but we still need your permission to access your camera. Our in app camera will guide you to where you should position your phone to capture the designated part of the loaction. Just follow the arrowa on the screen and fit to the frame. When you're happy with youre frame (and so is the app - the frame will go green when there is a good position) press the shutter button and take your photo. If you are happy with the photo press "Yes" and then upload your photo to join the others taken by others who have stood where you stand. Your photo and experience are now shared.</p>

								<h2>Why?<br />
								</h2>
								<p>Everyone is obsessed with getting the best photo. People flock to a picturesque location just to get the perfect shot. We remove the pressure of having to choose a spot in your 360 degree view, we tell you exactly where to frame your photo and combine it with many others in the community and create an online 360degree view for all weather and times of day to ensure you see the full picture of what the loaction can really look like in all variations..</p>

								<h2>Target Audience<br />
								</h2>
								<p>The target audience for Big Picture is anyone who has an interest in the outdoors, views and basic photography skills, and wanting to be apart of an online and offline community. The app only allows you to be apart of the locations group if you scan the QR code at the location, so the more places you go the more locations you collect. It turns travelling into a reward, by gaining physical access to the QR code you gain access to a group of people who have also been to that place.</p>

								<h2>Aim<br />
								</h2>
								<p>The aim of Big Picture is to create and inspire people to go out and explore. There is a very negative perception on excessive internet users that they are lazy and unfit. Big Picture aims to create an online community to assist in other users adventures and connect people with a like mind for beautiful views.Often when people go to see a site it’s only once they get to see that area but what if it was bad weather that day? or a day prior to that there was a gorgeous sunset, the collage allows users to see how everone else saw it. </p>
